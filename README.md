# Prolog Natural Language Parser

by: Hector Antonio Cardenas

Files:
  - parser.pl
  - 
  
How to run:
  - Open SWI Prolog and load the file parser.pl
  - To evaluate a query, type sent(X).
  - After that, my program will ask for input, which needs to be writed as a sentence.
  - Finally, it will either return false if the sentence is gramatically-invalid or a logic structure and a parse tree if it is English-valid
